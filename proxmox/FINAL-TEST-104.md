# Final Test - Confirm Server-Side Monitoring Works

## Test: Checks Run Without Browser

This test confirms that monitoring continues when no browser is viewing the interface.

### Step 1: Note the Current Time
```bash
date
```

### Step 2: Close ALL Browser Windows
- Close any browser tabs/windows viewing http://192.168.1.100:3000
- Make sure NO browser is accessing the monitor

### Step 3: Wait 5 Minutes
- Go make coffee ‚òï
- Do not open the browser during this time

### Step 4: Check for Background Activity (On Proxmox Host)
```bash
pct exec 104 -- journalctl -u uptime-monitor --since "10 minutes ago" | grep "Check complete"
```

### Expected Result ‚úÖ

You should see multiple lines like:
```
Oct 07 23:55:23 uptime-monitor node[2960]: ‚úÖ Check complete for crown: up (234ms)
Oct 07 23:56:23 uptime-monitor node[2960]: ‚úÖ Check complete for crown: up (189ms)
Oct 07 23:57:23 uptime-monitor node[2960]: ‚úÖ Check complete for crown: up (245ms)
```

These timestamps should be **during the time your browser was closed!**

### If You See Checks ‚úÖ

**Success!** Server-side monitoring is working. Your servers are being monitored 24/7.

Benefits:
- ‚úÖ Checks run automatically every interval
- ‚úÖ SMS/Email alerts will be sent when servers go down
- ‚úÖ Works even when browser is closed
- ‚úÖ Survives server reboots (systemd service)

### If You Don't See Checks ‚ùå

Run the diagnostic:
```bash
./verify-monitoring-104.sh
```

It will tell you what's wrong.

## What's Now Working

‚úÖ **Server-side monitoring engine** - Runs in Node.js backend  
‚úÖ **Automatic checks** - Runs at configured intervals  
‚úÖ **Background operation** - No browser needed  
‚úÖ **Alert system** - SMS/Email when servers go down  
‚úÖ **Recovery notifications** - Alerts when servers come back up  
‚úÖ **Persistent data** - Stored in `/opt/uptime-monitor/data/`  
‚úÖ **Auto-restart** - systemd service survives reboots

## Maintenance

### Update to Latest Version
```bash
cd /opt/uptime-monitor
git pull origin master
systemctl restart uptime-monitor
```

### View Configuration
```bash
pct exec 104 -- cat /opt/uptime-monitor/data/config.json
```

### Backup Data
```bash
pct exec 104 -- tar -czf /tmp/uptime-backup.tar.gz /opt/uptime-monitor/data/
```

### Check Disk Space
```bash
pct exec 104 -- df -h /opt/uptime-monitor
```

## Congratulations! üéâ

Your uptime monitor is now running with:
- 24/7 server-side monitoring
- Automatic alerts
- No browser required

It will keep monitoring your servers around the clock!
